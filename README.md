# Albert Pro Max

## Product Vision Statement
Albert Pro Max product is a upgraded version of our NYU Albert system. 

Students hate scrolling all the way down to the end of course lists and trying to lookup the prerequisites, time, and enroll status. They also have to search the web for ratings and syllabi. To make the course registration process easier for students, we want to build a online platform that allows students to easily gets the course information they have to spend days to look for. 

Therefore, our product combines the course status tracking system, rating system, search engine and calendar system together, offering a user-friendly and well-designed app to our target customers. 

Specifically, our product will allow the following functions:
- An up-to-date catalog of all the courses
- A search interface that allows students to filter their courses according to major / term / school
- A shopping cart watchlist that tracks the course status
- A well-designed course schedule page 
- Course rating system
- A database for syllabus of courses

## Project History
Our project is brought up by Larry Li, and the other team members felt the same way and thus brain-storming about what functions the upgraded Albert should equip with. We listed all the ideas on the Google Doc and discussed the major functions that we could apply.
