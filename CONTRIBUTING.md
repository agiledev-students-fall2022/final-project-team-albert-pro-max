# Team norms
## Team values
- respect team merit: pull requests must be reviewed and merged by other members.
- members should try the problems first before asking help from the others.
- resolving conflicts:
  - when there are disagreements, discuss and vote on directions during daily standups.
  - what to do when a member is failing to deliver on their obligations to the team.
  - members are expected to respond to direct messages within 1 hour (except during class).
## Sprint cadence
- 2 weeks per sprint
- Scrum Master and Project Owner are determined based on the lexicographical order of group membersâ€™ first names:
  - sprint 1 Scrum Master: Bernice Wu; Product Owner: Elaine Shan.
  - sprint 2 Scrum Master: Jiaming Li; Product Owner: Larry Li.
  - sprint 3 Scrum Master: Richard Xu; Product Owner: Bernice Wu.
  - sprint 4 Scrum Master: Elaine Shan; Product Owner: Jiaming Li.
## Daily standups
- 8pm Monday and Wednesdays, last for 15 minutes.
- members expected to be present synchronously (Zoom or in-person).
- if one or more members cannot make it, they must notify the group before noon of daily standups for rescheduling.
- members who make no progress on a task for two standups or more in a row will be reported to management.
## Coding standards
- all JavaScript code should follow conventions specified in [this link](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp).
